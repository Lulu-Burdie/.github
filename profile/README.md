### 🚀 Our Mission
We are a mission-driven micro-business dedicated to empowering mums to breastfeed longer and more comfortably. By combining luxury seamless comfort with a patent-pending swap-insert system, we eliminate the daily barriers of leakage and the stress of constant wardrobe changes.

### 🌍 Impact & Sustainability
At Lulu & Burdie, we believe in a future where "premium" also means "planet-positive":
* **Waste Reduction:** Each bra is designed to replace over 1,000+ single-use disposable pads over a 6-month period.
* **Certified Quality:** We exclusively use Oeko-Tex® and GOTS-certified materials to ensure the highest safety standards for both mum and baby.
* **Health Advocacy:** Our work is intentionally aligned with NHS and WHO goals to improve breastfeeding outcomes and maternal confidence.

### 💡 Intellectual Property
We are building a robust foundation of IP to support our global growth:
* **Patent-Pending:** Unique swap-insert system for all-day dryness.
